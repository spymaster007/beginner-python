#Variables
##Variables are assigned like so:
```
variablebob = 12*13
```

##Use:
Variables are used to store information for later use. For instance,
```
print (12*41825478143)*5
print (12*41825478143)*6
print (12*41825478143)*7
```
Is far more annoying to type than
```
bign = (12*41825478143)
print bign * 5
print bign * 6
print bign * 7
```

##Types:
Variables can be:
* Integers
* Strings
* Booleans
* Floats

#Conditionals
##Expressions:
Expressions determine when a conditional takes effect. For instance,
```
if x == y:
print "TOMATATOMATOTATOPOTATO"
```
would write TOMATATOMATOTATOPOTATO when x equaled y.

##Branching:
You can use the `else` command to create branches. To add to the earlier example, if we were to add
```
else:
print "No."
```
Would say No. when x did not equal y.
